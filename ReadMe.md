## Architecture

Cinemate was built to run on particularly iOS and Android (not fully optimised for Web). It uses [Expo](https://expo.dev/) as a core lib to build and distribute to all the platforms.

### APIs

## Testing on your phone

You can download the app for android on [Cinemate Download](https://expo.dev/artifacts/eas/xzPdeZAmnypHogNpXMGmuT.apk).
